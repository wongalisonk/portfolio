						<p>To establish the basics for writing HTML and CSS code, I was tasked with creating a mobile-friendly website based on reference pictures provided with a specific set of instructions for a fake cafe. One of the main objectives of this project was to create the website using a "mobile-first" approach. The theory behind this was it is always easier to add more information to a website than to take information away.</p>
						<p>With this approach, the mobile version of the website provided the audience with the core information required. In contrast, the website on larger screens provided more images in order to feel more inviting and aesthetically pleasing. The mobile-first approach was achieved by leveraging the <a href=http://getbootstrap.com/ target="_blank"> Bootstrap</a> framework.</p>

				<h1>The Components</h1>
				<h2>Almost like a puzzle</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<p>The layout of the website is a responsive, one-page theme. It comprises of six main components which included the navigation bar, header area, information section, menu, an “Our Story” section, and the footer. Each section is designed to ‘collapse’ on a mobile screen based from screen size (pixels). For each section, a set of specific construct was given for me to follow. It included the changes that were needed with each change in screen size.</p>
						<p>As I worked on creating this website, I would focus on making sure the fullscreen and mobile version of the website was working before moving on. This way I had and idea of what I needed to accomplish for the next section with code I could refer to on later parts. This was especially true for the CSS code for the different screen sizes.</p>
						<p>For the scalability factor of the website, many factors were taken into consideration. This included changing the font size to scale with the screen size for readability as well as storing images in multiple sizes in order to maintain the aspect ratio of the image to prevent it from looking blurry at higher resolutions. Storing multiple image sizes also decrease the load time necessary for smaller screen sizes. Because of the smaller screen sizes, displaying the smaller images do not diminish the resolution.</p>

				<h1>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs)</h1>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-5">
						<figure class="figure">
							<img src="../img/dawgcoffee/svg.png" class="figure-img">
							<figcaption class="figure-caption text-xs-left"><i>Coffee cup SVG (with and without hover) compared to normal link on hover</i></figcaption>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-7">
						<p>With the mobile-first approach to the project, it was important for the graphics used to scale the same ways the font and image sizes do. Rather than storing the graphics in multiple sizes to alleviate the resolution problem that plagues normal .jpgs or .pngs,  the use of SVGs were used. With SVGs, the graphics could scale to become as little or as big as necessary without becoming pixelated.</p>
						<p>Another neat trick that can be accomplished with SVGs is the fact that they can be colored using CSS code. This provides the navigation bar with the ability to have the coffee cup as the home link while still maintaining the color change on hover effect.</p>
