						<h1><center>Introduction</center></h1>
						<h2>The Conundrum</h2>
						<p>Given free rein to choose <b>any project of our choosing</b>, our team of 6 were stumped. We scoured the internet for inspiration for our project to no avail. Finally, out of desperation, one person suggested we look at the <b>website for Dawgpound Beer.</b> It was the perfect project for my team to re-create the entire website because the original layout of the website is downright atrocious.</p>
						<p>We began to discuss what sort of <b>changes would be required for us to work on</b> in the long run since this was to be a quarter long project. This ended up being <b>very interesting to work</b> on because at the time I was <b>under the drinking age and had no knowledge of how the alcohol selling business worked.</b> But I saw a lot of potential for this website so we forged on ahead.</p>
						<p>Each stage of the project came with an <b>in-depth written document as a part of the project deliverables.</b> In these, our team described the <b>progress</b> we made on the project, <b>significant information</b> that we wanted to share (such as feedback), details on how the <b>current stage of the project</b> was improving the website, and <b>what we would be working on next.</b></p>
						<h4>Check out the interactive Axure prototype <a href="http://hgky7h.axshare.com/age_checker.html" target="_blank">here.</a> Keep in mind that the prototype is best viewed at the fixed width due to the program limitations.</h4>

						<h1>Stage 1: Estblishing the Project</h1>
						<h2>Defining Objectives &amp; Creating Personas</h2>
						<p>The first stage of the project was to <b>define the objectives of our project.</b> What did we want to accomplish? We viewed the project from <b>multiple angles</b>, from what the <b>customers</b> would want out of the website to the <b>business aspect</b> of it. The two major things were to <b>establish a brand presence</b> as well as work on the <b>improving the customer experience</b> when interacting with the website. The first step of achieving these goals was to <b>establish personas.</b></p>
						<p>It was important to create both internal (workers of Dawgpound Beer) and external (customers) personas. We envisioned the interactions they would have with the website as well as what their priorities were. This was the baseline for how to proceed with the project.</p>

						<h1>Stage 2: Content Strategy</h1>
						<h3>Forming the Basics</h3>
						<p>After the personas had been finalized, we moved onto <b>content strategy.</b> The content strategy was designed to <b>inform goals, processes, and systems for content creation</b> and governance in order to reach new audiences and build stronger engagement opportunities with current customers. For this project we projected <b>two outcomes</b> during the content strategy stage: (1) Increased efficiency will create <b>higher quality, more engaging content</b> that attracts new audiences and supports brand advocacy among current subscribers, and (2) Greater organization of content will create <b>measurable tracks for brand awareness, visibility, and engagement opportunities.</b></p>
						<p>Part of the content strategy was the content map which was an illustration that depicts the contents included in each page and how some <b>content may lead to others</b> on other pages and how they are related in functionalities. This was really the first glimpse we had on how the <b>new website would function.</b></p>
						<p>Other parts of the content strategy included a quantitative audit (page inventory), qualitative audit (content assessment), templates for the web content, and an editorial calendar as a guide for the schedule of the project.</p>

						<h1>Stage 3 &amp; 4: Sitemap &amp; Wireframes</h1>
						<p>For the next stage of the project, it was time to create the sitemap and wireframes. This was the exciting part of the project because all of the <b>initial planning was finally put together</b> for the first look at the re-design. The new design featured an <b>online keg reservation process</b> as well as a more <b>robust browsing experience</b> for customers to view Dawgpound's inventory.</p>
						<p>The first iteration of the design <b>relied heavily on conventions that are popular among websites.</b> They were implemented after <b>viewing several popular brewing company websites.</b> Our team complied a list of what we felt were the best features of each and put them into our design. These included the <b>style of the navigation bar and the browsing sections.</b></p>

						<h1>Stage 5 &amp; 6: Iteration through User Testing</h1>
						<p>It was time for iteration for our design where we <b>continually went back to the design</b> to point out areas that could be improved. We received <b>feedback through focus groups, group discussions, and scripted user testing.</b> We began to focus more heavily on the aesthetics of the website which included <b>color scheme, font, size, and placement.</b> For a more realistic prototype, <b>real data and images were used to mimic a real website.</b> The continuous feedback we received helped tremendously with finding improvements. For the final iteration, a darker theme was chosen since the white was harsh on the eyes. But we still wanted to keep the overall appearance both clean while emphasizing the tie to the University of Washington (the purple and gold/yellow). </p>
						<p>In order to provide the best possible user experience, we integrated the <b>prototype with interactions.</b> The button will provide <b>user feedback</b> when clicked (such as the reservation page appearing when the 'reserve' button is clicked). </p>
						<p>Although we invested a lot of time in <b>putting availability icons</b> in the early stages of the project, testing ultimately told us that they <b>confused the users more than they helped.</b> From this I learned that although visualization does help get information across better in many cases, <b>sometimes it causes more confusion instead.</b></p>
