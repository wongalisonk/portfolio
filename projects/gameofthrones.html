								<p>HBO's Game of Thrones was chosen as my topic because I was a fan of the show and it has a lot of potential information I could showcase. I ended up choosing deaths as the central theme of the infographic because I was able to find a website with the data. The data (which only had season 1-5 at the time of my infographic's creation) can be found <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/game-of-thrones/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 1</span> Choosing Models</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<h4 class="subheader">Emulation</h4>
								<p>The goal of the infographic was not to create one entirely from scratch, but rather use infographic with unrelated topics as models. There were four infographics I ended up using, emulating a different aspect of each to incorporate and adapt to fit my infographic.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader2">Typography Analysis</h4>
								<p>I chose to use an infographic entitled <a href="http://static.businessinsider.com/image/4bbf5bcc7f8b9a4107340600/ipad-infographic-large.jpg" target="_blank"><i>Unboxing the iPad Data</i></a> as my typography model because it emphasized numbers since the topic was the number of deaths.</p>
								<p>The first step was identifying the font(s) used in the original infographic. To do so, I used a website called <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/" target="_blank">MyFonts</a> which has a tool that allows you to upload an image to identify the font. The closest font I could find was called Univers 57 Condensed.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/typography.png" />
								<p>The next step was to strip the original infographic down to just the text and approximating the font sizes. Once that was completed, the most important part of the analysis was color coding the uses of text. This was useful because I was able to establish a typography hierarchy by constantly referring back to it.</p>

								<br><br>

								<h4 class="subheader2">Visual Language</h4>
								<p>I wanted the ability to leverage both the use of icons and real images in my infographic and therefore I decided to use an infographic titled <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp_media-prod/app/uploads/2015/07/14160102/PR-009482_Static_D4_V1_wo-lh.png" target="_blank"><i>Blockbuster Marketing</i></a>, that effectively used both of these elements as my model.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/visuallang.png" />
								<p>I conducted a visual language analysis to focus on the details and the nuances of the use of images and icons. For example, the color to adjust the monochromatic images was a darker shade of the background color it was placed upon rather than an exact match. The icons appear very angular and stylized at first, but I noticed that they did use some rounded shapes. </p>

								<br><br>

								<h4 class="subheader2">Color</h4>
								<p>For my color model, I knew that I would need to pick an infographic that had a lot of colors since the Game of Thrones universe is so expansive. I also wanted to pick a model that used mainly shades of red because of the association with violence and death. The infographic <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/a1/8c/2fa18c35f5cd84e9a0dc76875662c272.jpg" target="_blank"><i>Zona de Guerra</i></a> used a wide array of reds that suited my needs.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/color.png" />
								<p>For the process of picking a color model, we were tasked with conducting a color analysis. The color analysis consisted of a color inventory, analyzing color harmony, and the use of color which included highlighting, encoding, associations, and tone. The color inventory included creating a color palette, evaluating combinations for text and backgrounds colors. For the color harmony, I analyzed the colors I had created from the color inventory. This included evaluating the saturation, brightness, and color harmony (monochromatic, complementary, split complementary, analogous, etc.).</p>

								<br><br>

								<h4 class="subheader2">Layout</h4>
								<p>I wanted to pick a layout that marked very clearly a path for the viewer to traverse through my infographic. I picked the infographic entitled <a href="http://practicalaction.org/media/download/29784" target="_blank"><i>The Forgotten Victims of Drought</i></a> because I felt it would be interesting to substitute the water for blood.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/layout.png" />
								<p>The layout analysis was focused on understanding how the information was presented and structured. I ended up taking some creative liberty with the layout because I had fewer elements that were much bigger than the elements in the model.</p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 2</span> Process</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>For each form of visual potential, I created two entirely different designs that represented the same information (such as a breakdown of the total deaths across the 5 seasons). Afterwards, I would present my two iterations to receive critique and feedback from at least three people. Based on my feedback, I would choose one of the two initial designs to iterate upon and change and improve. The new iteration would be presented next to the original and receive additional feedback. After, I would iterate upon that feedback once more.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/revision.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader2">Feedback</h4>
								<p>The feedback I received during each phase would sometimes be conflicting (e.g. someone would tell me to make a change while someone else really liked how it looked originally). Part of the design process was deciding whether or not to incorporate the feedback that I received.</p>
								<p>Sometimes I would agree with the changes. Other times I would concede that a change needed to be made, but not necessarily the change suggested. Sometimes, I even felt that I should ignore the critique and either not make any changes or do something completely different. However, if I decided on this option, I had to have <i>justification</i> for why I chose to do so. The feedback was critical to my overall design, but in the end all the final decisions were up to me.</p>
								<p>Each element in my infographic was created separately but emulated the same models and went through the same process. This was the cycle that I repeated for all five forms of visual potential and for the layout of my final infographic.</p>
								<p>A compilation of the feedback and critique I received throughout the entire process as well as the previous iterations of each display can be seen in the link below.</p>

								<h4 class="subheader2">Final Iteration</h4>
								<p>I had a final iteration phase during the creation of the layout of my infographic where I finally got to see all the elements together. Here, I had the opportunity to make changes to the displays to help them feel more cohesive. There was a lot of tweaking and small changes to make in order to make the elements the right size while retaining readability.</p>
								<p>Based on the layout model I had chosen, many of the displays had to be reorganized to fit into the space that I had available.</p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 3</span> Visual Potential</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<h4 class="subheader">Elements Showcase</h4>
								<p>Through the use of the different types of visual potential, I was able to present the data for the same 704 deaths in 6 unique ways.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader2">Appearance</h4>
								<p>Appearance is the potential to use representations that viewers will recognize or representations that teach viewers how something/someone looks.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/appearance.png" />
								<p>Appearance was used greatly throughout my infographic. These ranged from icons that represented known simple objects (e.g. swords, arrows, etc.) or depicted well-known places from the show. I also used images of main characters that are easily recognizable.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader2">Numbers</h4>
								<p>Numbers is the potential to use the number/amount/size of things on a page or screen to represent the number/amount/size of things in the world.</p>
								<p>For numbers, I had two different representations. I decided to breakdown the total number of deaths across the five seasons by season in the first display and by method of death (e.g. sword, arrow, etc.) in the second. I felt these two displays generated the most interest.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/numbers1.png" />
								<p>In the first display, it was intriguing to see how the number of deaths have differ from season to season, especially noting the difference between season 1 and season 5. For the second display, I felt that breaking down the deaths by method was interesting because you could see the variety of methods but also how a majority of those deaths were by a sword or blade of some sort.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/numbers2.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader2">Location</h4>
								<p>Location is the potential to use position on the page or screen to represent positions of things or places relative to each other in the world. </p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/location.png" />
								<p>Following the theme of my topic, I decided to show the top five deadliest locations on a map of the Game of Thrones universe. To help situate the viewer better, I decided to create icons that represented prominent landmarks from each of those locations to help viewers recognize and/or recall that city/location and the events that took place there.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader2">Time</h4>
								<p>Time is the potential to use relative position along a line or relative position in a grid or circle to represent when events occur/occurred in time relative to each other.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/time.png" />
								<p>For time, I wanted to show when the deaths of major or prominent character occurred throughout the show. I also color encoded the characters who were from the same house/family to be the same color to help with association.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader2">Relationship</h4>
								<p>Relationships is the potential to use connections between shapes on a page to represent connections between things or people in the real world.</p>
								<img src="../images/gameofthrones/relationship.png" />
								<p>Relationship was a tricky element for me to create. I wanted something that was aligned with my theme, but was also provided the viewer with new information. I decided to create a relationship display showing which family/house were killed the most after 5 seasons. For the relationship aspect I showed which families/houses were responsible for the deaths and how many they accounted for. </p>

								<p>This was a tremendous learning opportunity for me because it provided me with motivation to learn the intricacies of Adobe Illustrator. It was also the only project I have worked on that was entirely solo. It was a good opportunity for me to hold myself responsible for the quality of work I created because all of the final elements were a reflection on the amount of effort I chose to put in.</p>
