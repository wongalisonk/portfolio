						<p>One of the most important lesson I learned was to think critically about how technology impacts our society. Rather than simply creating technology for the sake of creating technology, we should take a step back and evaluate the repercussions. It is important to remember that technology can be used to strive towards equality between groups experiencing a inequity. We have the resources to help assuage current social injustices and we should use them.</p>
						<p>I was englightened about the fact that technology often exacerbates the disparities between two social groups. This is particularly prominent between the wealthier population (those with access to technology) and those in poverty. Technology continues to benefit the rich while leaving the poor further behind. It is important for technology to strive to benefit everyone.</p>
						<p>For a final project, my team and I set forth to create a resource for a social group facing inequity. We decided to create a resource to help the transgender community, a group that has become more prominent in recent times (although this does not, by any means, mean that this group has not suffered injustice before our time).</p>

				<h1>Planning Phase</h1>
				<h2>Defining the Idea</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<figure class="figure">

							<figcaption class="figure-caption text-xs-left"><i>The goal of Gift of Comfort</i></figcaption>
						<figure>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>The scenario my professor gave us was that we had unlimited resources to create our design. We deliberated on what we thought was important for the transgender community and what sort of resources they needed. Gender identity seemed to be the big, glaring idea, but what could we do to help? Clothes! Clothing is a huge part of how a person expressed themselves. Often, many individuals who are still questioning their gender may want try expressing themselves differently. This may be dangerous for those who live around people who may disagree vehemently.</p>
						<p>We decided to create a mock company that created packages of clothing for those who were unable to obtain the style of clothing that fit their gender identity. These reasons could range from lack of resources to fear of public ridicule or fear of safety. Regardless, the package was designed to help those in need. </p>
						<p>One of the tough parts was thinking of a fitting name. My team wanted to pick something that symbolized our product, but was discrete enough to not be suspicious. After a few hours of brainstorming, we finally thought of the Gift of Comfort. The idea behind the name was that the clothes we sent were meant to comfort those currently uncomfortable in their own body. With the name taken care of, it was time for us to decide what we needed to put on the website in order to achieve the idea.</p>

				<h1>Donating &amp; Receiving</h1>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-1"></div>
					<div class="col-sm-10">
						<p>To help with costs, we envisioned the Gift of Comfort running as a nonprofit. The clothes that are sent in the packages would be donated from people who wish to help our cause. Additionally, for those who lack clothes to send but still wish to help are able to send in money donations that go towards keeping the organization going. The monetary donations would go towards buying clothing or specialty items that pre-transition people may require to feel more comfortable.</p>
						<p>For the donation process, since we would not have a physical location (such as Goodwill) for patrons to donate clothing, patrons can request a bag with prepaid postage to ship their clothes to the processing facility. We envisioned this as the easiest way for those who wish to donate to send their clothes.</p>
						<p>The receiving process is much more simple, with beneficiaries requesting a package. A space was added in order for specific requests and accommodations that they wished to have included in their package (such as style of clothing, size, etc.) During our feedback session, the question of security and preventing exploitation arose. Although this was more nuance than the project required, we still took it into consideration. To prevent exploitation, we could find a way to track a person's IP address. This would be the safest way to prevent exploitation without compromising privacy. As for security, using a 3rd party cloud data storage service would offer the best protection.</p>

				<h1>Help Section</h1>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-5">
						<p>We thought it was important and pertinent to add a section to provide information for those who wish to learn more. These online resources are organized into three categories to be quick and easily to read through at a glance. At the bottom of the section is a contact section for those in a crisis. This idea was conceived to be similar to the suicide hotline. It would appear as a reminder that help is available for those who need it.</p>

				<h1>Reflection</h1>
				<h2>Looking Back</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>In hindsight, I am not sure how well this project would have helped with transgender community overall. The initial concept seemed to be a good idea, but there were probably better ways to help prevent inequity better. I wish that we had more time for planning and researching (compared to the 2 weeks we had to complete this project).</p>
						<p>On the design side of things, I may change the theme to be more gender neutral. The site feels overly flashy at times where it should be more inconspicuous. The original intentions were well-intended, but in evaluating effectiveness I think it is lacking.</p>
