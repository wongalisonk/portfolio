				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<h2>The Topic: "Surviving College"</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<p>My Design Thinking class was essentially a quarter-long project that was my first introduction to the concept of user experience design (and the differences from user interface design). At the beginning of this project, my professor randomly assigned the class into teams of 3 and unveiled the topic. Each team was tasked with creating anything (mobile application, web resource, etc.) pertaining to the topic. This felt overwhelming to me; the sudden freedom (and responsibility) was downright terrifying. There were endless possibilities for my team to explore and we were tasked to narrowing it down to one idea. My team took some time and brainstormed ideas.</p>
						<p>Eventually, we settled on creating a resource to help alleviate the difficulty students at the University of Washington faced when attempting to join clubs and keeping track of events. It was still a very broad idea, but considering we started at "surviving college," we called it progress.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-7">
						<p>In order for my team to get over the fear of brainstorming <i>bad ideas</i>, my professor assigned us the task of individually producing 40 ideas. I had high hopes of conceiving THE idea within those 40. Afterall, 40 ideas is a lot (so I thought), at least one of them had to be good, right? 40 ideas later, I still felt unsure of myself. Some ideas I knew were really bad, and the rest I deemed merely bad.</p>

						<p>After discussing with my team, we knew that we wanted to stay away from physical mediums (such as posters, fliers, or help booths). Our main focus was finding a medium that allowed a great deal of flexibility since we wanted to encompass numerous details we felt were important. Some of the original ideas we had included a way for officers of a club to communicate and organize events. We also played around with the idea of incorporating a method for members to have more effect and power on club meetings and events, such as time and location. Understanding the basis of our idea, we narrowed down three ideas (that we deemed had potential) from our combined total of over 100.</p>

				<h1>Iterating Ideas &amp; User Testing</h1>
				<h2>Understanding the Audience</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<p>After narrowing it down to three ideas, each of my team members took one idea and designed a paper prototype. I was tasked with creating a prototype for a Facebook application. This was one of the three ideas because we reasoned that many students already used Facebook to keep track of events, therefore providing the ability to also track clubs on the same platform was ideal. The goal of my prototype was to help students keep the events more organized without being cumbersome to use. We wanted to avoid creating something that students will use once before forgetting about its existence.</p>
						<p>For our user testing, we asked fellow classmates to navigate the three prototypes we had made (a Facebook add-on, a mobile application for the RSO, and an addition to the current MyUW site). I conducted my user testing with fellow students in class. I introduced the idea for my team's project to the user as well as the platform I would be presenting them (a Facebook application). Afterwards, I had a series of tasks I had them complete. These tasks included navigating between screens and identifying what certain icons meant.It became apparent that there were navigation issues. One of the most important things I came to understand is how I, as a designer, created a prototype that I could navigate flawlessly. Attempting to help users navigate prototypes made by my teammates proved difficult since I could not follow the line of thought they had when they created their prototype. I envisioned and tried to create my prototype to be as easy and intuitive to navigate as possible but in reality, was not the case.</p>
						<p>After each person in our team conducted our user tests, we reconvened to take stock of our findings. And one thing was evident: we still had a lot of work to do. While the theory behind each prototype seemed sound, the reality left something to be desired. </p>

				<h1>The DECISION</h1>
				<h2>Narrowing Scope</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<p>After our intensive (and eye-opening) user testing, it was finally time to decide on what we wanted to focus on for the final design specification. We knew this was going to be an imperative decision because we needed to stick with it for the rest of the quarter. Deliberation began and none of us felt confident in the future prospects of our current prototypes. Unable to come up with a solid idea, we were stuck. Faced with a conundrum, we took a step back and approached our problem from a differently angle. We discussed what went wrong with our initial ideas, and focused on what went well.</p>
						<p>Understanding that trying to target as much of the student population as possible was holding us back because we were being overambitious helped facilitate us towards the idea we would use. We used this revelation to evaluate a solution in a new light. A new consensus was achieved: less is more. We scrapped all three of our ideas and thought smaller. Literally. Well, at least in screen size: my group decided to design a mobile application.</p>
						<p>The major ideas that we wanted to keep was the idea of allowing Facebook integration. We felt this was important because so many clubs on campus currently have Facebook pages and post events on Facebook. Narrowing our scope, we determined that focusing solely on events was the path to take. The mobile platform was chosen because we believed it would be most convenient considering the fact that almost all of the student population owns a smartphone. We had to leave behind ideas we thought would be useful to incorporate, but it made our overall concept more refined and feel more sophisticated.</p>

				<h1>Refinement</h1>
				<h2>It's the little things</h2>

					<div class="col=sm-8">
						<p>The first iteration of our new idea seemed promising. We knew we still had a lot of kinks to iron out, but we were enthusiastic about the route we had taken with the project. I was able to hone a lot of my skills of designing an application through this project since I took it upon myself to create the mockups that were used in the final project.</p>
						<p>Further user tests showed that we were making progress, but still had some ways to go. The users that sampled our prototype provided us with more positive feedback than our previous three ideas, but there were still huge flaws for us to consider. It was a little worrisome at the beginning because it made me wonder if we had picked an idea that would work. The 10 Heuristics helped target a lot of the flaws our design had. Using that feedback, I was able to refine details in our initial mockups (above) that helped polish it into the finished product (left).</p>

				<h1>Final Product</h1>
				<h2>UW MyClubs</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<p>Our final design was a very streamlined version of our initial concept. It was minimalistic, but not the point where it confused users and it was simplistic. It achieved our goal in what I believe to be a very effective method. It allows for students to browse clubs and events. A feature is implemented to track clubs, but also allows for small user flexibility. I believe that it was the small, refined details that were key to our design.</p>
						<p>A major epiphany that moved the project forward was letting go of the idea of a feature for club officers to communicate. Acknowledge that some good ideas hindered great ideas was not easy to learn, but the lesson was an important one.</p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<h2>A Reflection on the 10 Weeks</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>I learned a great deal more in this class than I would have initially thought. It was surprising how much I was able to learn about the design process in the 10 weeks we had. And I realized I still have a great deal more to learn. Our initial concept seemed pretty easy at the beginning: designing a product that could help the student population facilitate and maintain events with reminders.</p>
						<p>Although many changes were made from our initial conceptions, we were able to create a design that fulfilled our ultimate goal. I feel as though my group functioned very well as a whole. There were small bumps along our journey, but they helped shaped our project and understanding of the design process. Looking back, I may have invested more time in additional user testing because I realized how invaluable feedback from the target population is. It felt tedious to conduct all the tests we did throughout the quarter, but they were instrumentally helpful in shaping the final design. Looking at our final, streamlined design, I felt a sense of overwhelming pride in what our group had accomplished in just 10 weeks.</p>
						<p>The skills I achieved were not only academic, but social. Group work was never something I had looked forward to in high school, but participating in a team of equally eager workers was astronomically fun. I feel as though I have learned a lot as a designer, but accept that I still have innumerable amount of things to learn, which I hope to do so in the future.</p>
