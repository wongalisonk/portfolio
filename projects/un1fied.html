You and your team will use, iterate and adapt this design language over the course of the quarter to design the core apps. All of your apps should look and feel like they are part of the same family."</i></p></center>
						<p>Smartwatches are still relatively new, and have not taken off like other technology (smartphones, tablets, etc.). My team of 8 decided to try to tackle this problem because we found a lot of potential, with a lot of <b>room for creativity and innovation.</b> Through some initial user research, we found that many people did not see how a smartwatch was better than a smartphone. There was a <b>quality of life aspect that was lacking.</b></p>

						<h1>Research &amp; Ideation</h1>
						<h2>Creating a Design Language</h2>
						</p>Initially, the team believed that the smartwatch was not adopted because it had to be paired to a smartphone. Because of this requirement, users saw a smartwatch as performing the <b>same functions, but on a smaller screen with more limited interactions.</b> We began our project by conducting a brief user survey to understand the current state of smartwatches in two populations: people who already owned a smartwatch and people who were tech savvy but did not own a smartwatch. We found that people wanted a smartwatch to be paired with their smartphone, but offer a more seamless experience.</p>

					<blockquote>“I think the point of a smartwatch isn't to replace a cellphone, it's to <b>enhance your experience</b> with one and <b>optimize the functionality</b> on a convenient, easier-to-access display. In ideal implementation, you would be able to <b>keep your cellphone completely on silent</b> (not even on vibrate) and handle messages and calls with <b>subtlety.</b>"</blockquote>

						<h1>The User's POV</h1>
						<p>Since our team had a mix of Mac and PC users we decided to used <a href="myclubs.pdf" target="_blank">Figma</a> to create prototypes. We chose this because of the focus on collaboration and since everything was saved online, it was easy to share all the changes. For the hardware, our team wanted to design on a <b>circular interface</b> because it emulated the timeless design of normal watches and felt more <b>elegant.</b> Additionally, a physical bezel was also implemented as a less obstructive interaction method since users would not have to interact on the screen. This left more of the screen available for display pertinent information.</p>

						<p>Our smartwatch differentiates from a smartphone in that it focuses on <b>limited the amount of necessary interactions.</b> We accomplished this through focusing on <b>user flows.</b> and evaluating what the user wants to do <b><i>in the moment.</i></b> keeping only the most essential functions displayed on the watch. Rather than attempting to achieve all functionality available on a phone, we optimized the most common interactions and made them <b>easier to do.</b></p>

						<h1>Weather</h1>
						<p>To focus on the <b>“in the moment”</b> aspect, the weather application first displays the current temperature at the user’s current location. Turning the bezel displays the <b>hourly information.</b> Flipping the “coin” displays the forecast for the current day while turning the bezel shows the user the daily forecast for the upcoming days (at the user’s current location).</p>

						<p><b>Icons are used in place of text</b> whenever possible so that the information can be read <b>at a glance.</b> Because of the limited screen size, only the most <b>pertinent</b> information is shown. For the hourly forecast, this included the <b>time, type of weather (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.), the current degrees, and the chance of rain.</b> For the daily/weekly forecast, this included the <b>day of the week, type of weather,  and high/low for the day.</b> The quick menu was kept as simple as possible, allowing the user to toggle between temperature scales (Fahrenheit or Celsius).</p>

						<h1>Contacts &amp; Dialer</h1>
						<h2>Contacts</h2>
						<p>LThe contacts focused on <b>fast information retrieval.</b> Rotating the bezel quickly scrolls through contacts by letter rather than by name. Each contact displays the option to either <b>call or message.</b> When selecting the call option, the circular interface would flip over <b>(“coin flip”)</b> and display the saved numbers for the contact as well as the <b>type</b> (mobile, phone, work, etc.).</p>
						<p>There is no option to add a new contact or updating an existing contact because the functionality is <b>not commonly used.</b> Our apps are focused on facilitating the most common functions of a smartphone <b> quickly and efficiently.</b></p>

						<h2>Dialer &amp; Calls</h2>
						<p>The dialer has an emphasis on the <b>circular interface and rotating bezel.</b> It is meant to mimic the older style of rotary phones, but in a more efficient manner. The <b>most common call features</b> are the ones kept in the design. This included <b>muting, accessing the dial pad, and adding people to the call.</b> Incoming calls allow for a quick access to a reject message to easily handle calls in busy situations (such as meetings). This means handling calls with <b>subtlety and easy.</b> </p>

						<h1>Future Viability</h1>
						<p>For many people on our team, it was their first time applying UX principles and designing UI. Only one of us owned a smartwatch or have interacted extensively with one. Designing for a small, circular interface was also very challenging. It forced me to <b>explain and defend all of my design decisions.</b> The lack of proper prototyping tools also forced our team to adapt for user testing (most tools do not provide methods for testing a round smarwatch interface). Even in our team of 8, designing for a circular interface proved a complex challenge to undertake in 10 weeks. I believe we have provided a strong foundation to do more work, with heavy user testing needed to be completed.</p>
