							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>The goal of this phase was to better understand the perception of smartwatches of both smartwatch owners and nonowners. The survey had a total of 74 respondents, 11 of which were smartwatch owners.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader">Goals for Smartwatch Owners</h4>
								<p>The most important insights that we were looking for from the survey data were:<br>(1) the most commonly used features/apps</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/owner_apps.png" />
								<p>(2) the features users liked the most and why and, (3) the features that needed to be changed or added From the survey, we also hoped to discover the most popular smartwatches to conduct an informal competitor analysis.</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/competitors.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader">Goals for Non-Smartwatch Owners</h4>
								<p>From the survey population that did not own smartwatches the most important question we wanted to answer was <i>why not?</i> From the survey, we wanted to learn why people did not own a smartwatch (besides costs) and what features or apps would appeal to them in a smartwatch.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader">Insights</h4>
								<p> Most people perceived that smartwatches were meant to perform exactly as a smartphone, but with a less seamless (i.e. clunky) experience. As a result, people's understanding of a smartwatch was <i>"why would I want to waste money on an inferior device when my phone does it all better."</i></p>
								<p>The biggest turn off for people from both target populations was, unsurprisingly, the small screen size. People also expressed a desire to spend as little time interacting with a smartwatch as possible.</p>
								<p> The top desired apps smartwatch nonowners wanted were navigation apps (such as Google maps, bus times, and travel times) and health-based apps (calorie tracking, pedometer, and heart rate monitor).</p>
								<h4 class="subheader">Summary</h4>
								<p>Two overarching ideas carried us over to the next phase of our project:</p>
								<ol class="fh5co-inline">
									<li>Users don't want a smartwatch to replace their cellphone, but rather to enhance their experience with one and optimize the functionality.</li><br>
									<img id="list" src="../images/un1fied/nonowner_phone.png" />
									<li>A smartwatch does not need to have all the functionality of a smartphone, but rather optimizes the most common tasks that a smartphone does by making it faster.</li><br>

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<h4 class="subheader">Guidelines</h4>
									<p>To achieve consistency in our designs across our team, we sat down and created a design language and a style guide that would facilitate our design process.</p>
									<img src="../images/un1fied/language.png">
									<p>Our design language consisted of four concepts created from our user research and brainstorming session. It was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our design in achieving user goals.</p>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="col-md-3"><img src="../images/un1fied/a.png" /></div>
										<div class="col-md-9">
										<h4 class="subheader2">Adaptable</h4>
										<p>The ability for users to use their watch in various settings by enabling them to interact with it using either their voice or fingers.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="col-md-3"><img src="../images/un1fied/b.png" /></div>
										<div class="col-md-9">
										<h4 class="subheader2">Easy to Use</h4>
										<p>The learning curve is gradual and the interface is intuitive, enabling users to navigate the watch with only one or two interactions.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="col-md-3"><img src="../images/un1fied/c.png" /></div>
										<div class="col-md-9">
										<h4 class="subheader2">Fast</h4>
										<p>Any goals for the user can be completed in as little number of taps or interactions as possible.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6">
										<div class="col-md-3"><img src="../images/un1fied/d.png" /></div>
										<div class="col-md-9">
										<h4 class="subheader2">Beautiful</h4>
										<p>An inviting interface that uses modern UI patterns so the transition from a phone or computer to our watch is seamless and smooth.</p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 3</span> Style Guide</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>While the design language was the framework to shape our thinking and approach to the design, the style guide was created to achieve consistency on the smaller details. This included details such as the color palette, typography, iconography, and some general UI patterns.</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/color_palette.png" />

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 4</span> Hardware</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>A balance of form and functionality was achieved by keeping the hardware as clean and minimal as possible while still allowing users to navigate easily.</p>
								<p>To maximize the use of the limiting screen size, the hardware was designed so that all interactions can be completed via the hardware of the watch and not the screen itself.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader">Prototyping</h4>
								<p>Several screen shapes were considered, such as the band (left), square (similar to the Apple Watch), and a curved rectangular screen shape (right).</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/prototype_early.png" />
								<p>After we finalized the screen shape, we created paper prototypes to get a better sense of how the UI would look to scale.</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/prototyping.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader">Finalized Hardware Specs</h4>
								<p>To emulate the elegant and timeless design of classic watches we created a smartwatch with a circular interface. Specific interactions are shown in the image below.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader2">Hands Free Gestures/Interactions</h4>
								<p>Another consideration we explored was the idea of hands free interactions. Since these interactions were for niche cases (used for one functionality in a specific app) they were not implemented in the final design.</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/hardware.png" />
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row row-bottom-padded-sm animate-box">
							<div class="col-md-3">
								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 5</span> Conceptualization</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p> For each stock application, our team would sit down and sketch out as many ideas as possible for a given app in a 5-minute timeframe. Afterwards, we would meet back up and discuss our ideas as a team. During these meetings we would consider things like, what are the similarities between the designs? are there any unique designs worth considering for the next iteration?, and what features would be unrealistic to implement?</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/process.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader">Low-Fidelity Mockups</h4>
								<p>With 12 apps to tackle in 10 weeks, our team decided to divide and conquer. We split our team of 8 into two smaller teams of 3 and a group of 2. After the initial big team brainstorming session, it was up to the smaller teams to use those ideas and distill them into an initial mockup/prototype.</p>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/lowfidelity.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader2">Big Picture First, Details Later</h4>
								<p>The first stage was focused on what information would be included and emphasis on user interactions. This stage was focused on evaluating how effective the information flow was in terms of what the user needed. The biggest challenge was striking a balance between providing the user with enough information, but not forcing them to interact with the watch excessively.</p>

								<h3 class="fh5co-section-heading"><span class="fh5co-number">Step 6</span> Iterate</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>The biggest question I found myself asking myself was <i>"what information can I get rid of? What doesn't the user need?"</i> It was easy to want to cram in as much information as possible across multiple screens. The most important thing was understanding the only information that was necessary was the information a user needed <i>in the moment</i> because if a user wanted more information, they would use their phone instead.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader">Weather (1st Iteration)</h4>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/weather_iteration.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader2">Problems</h4>
								<p>Information was scattered across too many screens. The initial mockups for the weather application was trying to convey the same amount of information as a phone application.</p>
								<h4 class="subheader">Contacts (1st Iteration)</h4>
								<img src="../images/un1fied/contacts_iteration.png" />
								<h4 class="subheader2">Problems</h4>
								<p>The intent of the partial circles on either side was to inform the user that more contacts were available. However, what ended up happening was that the information in the middle (the important information) was too small and as a result, hard to see.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<h4 class="subheader">Lessons Learned</h4>
								<p>Big teams are hard to work with. Everyone has an opinion and never do we all agree on something unanimously. It takes a group effort to get work done and most of the effort requires constant, open, and honest communication. Also, circular interfaces are <i>really</i> hard to design for.</p>
								<p>In the future when working in larger groups, having structured meetings are a necessity. This means going in with goals for the meeting and cutting discussions short if needed.</p>
