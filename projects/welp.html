						<p>For my web development class, my professor gave my team free rein on what we wanted to create for our final project using the knowledge we had acquired in the class. My team and I designed, created, and implemented a website similar to RateMyProfessor, but for classes offered at University of Washington.</p> 
						<p>Leveraging the power of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>, we created a website that allowed for students to create accounts, log in, and leave reviews for classes. We decided to crowd-source the data for classes available by allowing students to add a new class in a department. The interface of the Welp website was kept minimalistic to simulate a vibe similar to Google.</p>

				<h1>The Inner Workings </h1>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>My team used Firebase as our cloud service for the backend of the website. During class, we were taught how to create and build apps on Parse. However, my team decided that Firebase was a more powerful alternative that suited the needs of our project better. We came upon this idea after brainstorming </p>
						<p>Using Firebase, Welp allows users to "writing a review" for a class through inserting the data into the system under the correct department. Afterwards, the code that we created is able to read the data from Firebase and display the information to people who browse our site similar to Yelp or RateMyProfessor. The data from the departments was stripped and cleaned from the existing data on departments off the official University of Washington website. </p>
						<p>A similar process undergone for the creation of new users. For the existing users logging back into Welp, we had to write code that scanned through the existing users to find a match before logging in the user.</p>

				<h1>The Front End</h1>
				<h2>AKA What the Users See</h2>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<figure class="figure">
							<img src="../img/welp/screens.png" class="figure-img">
							<figcaption class="figure-caption text-xs-left"><i>Search (home), browse, and login screens accessed from the navigation bar</i></figcaption>

						<br>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<p>Originally for the theme of the website, my team wanted to reflect the school colors (purple and gold). After much deliberation and discussion, we reached the decision of keeping Welp as minimalistic as possible. As a result, we look towards Google as inspiration. We chose to model part of the theme after Google due to the clean look that the search results page produces. To mimic this, we chose a white background with simple, tidy colors as accents. </p>
						<p>The home page and login screens were kept as simple as possible to avoid any confusion. The main purpose of Welp is to provide students with information on classes offered at the University of Washington. A verdict was reached were a simple search bar would greet students. This provided the simplest way for students to find classes they have heard about and want to learn more. For students that want to see what classes are offered by department to find classes to fill up their schedule, the browse option is shown. </p>
						<p>The top navigation bar was kept as simple as possible to maintain the theme. The search (home screen) and browse buttons are easily visible. The login link was placed in the common location to provide users with the familiarity of most websites. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h1>The Reviews</h1>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>The design for the reviews page was based heavily off of the RateMyProfessor website with a mixture of our chosen simplistic theme. Most prominent on the page is the title of the class and the University of Washington assigned number. Underneath is a description of the class. A smaller font size is chosen since this information can be gathered from the UW’s course registry. For the crowd-sourced information, the overview was designed to provide students with a quick, overarching view of the class. From there they could scroll down to read reviews if they were interested in learning more. </p>
						<p>The design of the page was for the information to flow from being vaguer to being more specific. The overview section visually delivers the information at a glance with the numbers and descriptive words being read after. Whitespace was an important consideration to provide all the attributes of the class page with enough space to be easily readable without overwhelming the reader or making it hard to read. </p>
						<p>The same structure applies for the reviews although it is implemented horizontally rather than vertically. The same categories for each individual review is shown most clearly with the numbers bolded for emphasis. If a user decides to continue reading, the ratings flows to the review in the same way as traditional reading (from right to left). The Z-formation of reading is continued for other reviews as the reader scrolls down the page. </p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>Our team’s coherency was lacking slightly overall, but we managed to create a project we were proud of. Because of the shorter time frame, the decisions made for the design of the website were made based on general conventions of most websites (such as the navigation bar and location of the login button) as well as personal opinion. Given more time, I would have conducted user testing to see what was the best way to display the information to users. </p>
						<p>I feel like a lack of communication was also detrimental to the overall success of the project. There were times when two people worked on the same part and ultimately resulted in some problems. We were able to sort them out, but notifying team members of what part each person would do would have been tremendously helpful. </p>
						<p>I was grateful to work in a team like this because I was able to learn a lot about web development from my super smart team members. But I was also grateful for an opportunity to reflect on our teamwork and how to improve team coherency in future teams that I will be a part of. </p>
